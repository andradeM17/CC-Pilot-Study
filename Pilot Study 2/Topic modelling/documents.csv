PREFACE FROM MRS SIMONE VEIL
The report on the free movement of persons was delivered a few days before the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome .
Forty years , the age of maturity , is a good time to take stock of the construction of Europe , to evaluate what the Treaty has made it possible to achieve in relation to the objectives it sets out and to determine what remains to be done .
It is true that the original Treaty has been amended on several occasions , in particular by the election of the European Parliament by universal suffrage , the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty .
But above all , the European Community , now the European Union , has experienced several enlargements and its economic , social and political environment has changed considerably .
At the same time , the basic texts have remained substantially the same , in particular the principles which govern the free movement of persons .
By setting up a high-level group of independent persons to propose ways of resolving the wide range of problems encountered by citizens who move to , or are considering moving to , another Member State of the Union , the Commission was responding to the idea that there were still a great many obstacles to the free movement of persons and that the objectives of the Treaties were far from being attained .
After hearing the views of representatives of trade unions and specialist bodies , we found that considerable progress has been made over the years thanks to the extensive legislative work accomplished and to the numerous judgments handed down by the Court of Justice on the subject .
Nevertheless , the examination of complaints , emanating from both individuals and associations , shows that all kinds of difficulties remain which are unacceptable in terms of the principles laid down and place at a disadvantage those who have chosen to move to another country .
Added to this are the administrative delays and red tape which seriously damage the view that firms and individuals have of the construction of Europe .
There are also grounds for believing that some citizens of the Union are deterred from moving to another Member State for fear of the obstacles they will encounter .
Before thoroughly investigating the problems identified , the group had to define the scope of the remit given to it by the Commission , in terms of both the persons expected to exercise the right to freedom of movement and the obstacles that lie in their path .
According to the letter setting out its tasks , the group was to focus on the problems encountered by Community nationals but , in addition , ' in certain cases , the problems of thirdcountry nationals legally resident in the Community will have to be taken into consideration since many of the known difficulties cut across this legal distinction ' .
PREFACE
Page 6
In view of the imprecise nature of this reference , it was decided to study as a priority only those categories of thirdcountry nationals who already enjoy certain rights related to freedom of movement , namely , the family members of a Union citizen , workers in a Community firm supplying services , and refugees and stateless persons .
This distinction may disappoint thirdcountry nationals legally resident in a Member State , who find it difficult to understand why they do not enjoy the same rights to freedom of movement and perceive this as a form of discrimination .
However , since questions relating to immigration policy normally fall within the Member States ' field of competence , we felt that it was not for us to prejudge the decisions which might be taken in connection with the work in progress within the Community institutions on the rules relating to the conditions governing the right of thirdcountry nationals to enter , move around within and remain in a Member State .
This being so , the group stressed that priority should be given to questions concerning the simple right to travel , which is already recognized by certain Member States who are signatories to the Schengen Convention , and the extension to thirdcountry nationals of the Community provisions on access to urgent medical treatment .
We were given the task of studying ' the existing or potential obstacles ' but it was not always easy for us to identify , among the problems brought to our attention , those which actually represent obstacles to the free movement of persons .
For , in many cases , the difficulties do not stem directly from the rules connected with free movement , but from indirect obstacles involving other areas of competence or resulting from differences in national laws .
Since our remit explicitly included the indirect obstacles associated with such areas as the free movement of goods and services , taxation and social rules in cases involving ' practical difficulties which a citizen encounters as a consumer ( transfer of funds , importation of personal belongings and motor vehicles , recognition of driving licences , taxes on the registration of motor vehicles , etc . ) ' , many specific proposals were tabled in this connection .
However , in response to problems resulting from the differences between national laws , the route of mutual recognition , which has the advantages of simplicity and speed and of complying with national law , has been advocated whenever it is conducive to the dismantling of obstacles to free movement : on the other hand , the utmost caution is called for in cases where harmonization proves necessary ."

The European Union funds the research Framework Programmes with theaim of helping researchers co-operate more closely to make Europe themost competitive economy in the world market place .
Thousands ofresearchers , from more than 30 European countries – and several morefrom further afield have participated – in projects supported through the Programmes and the number is growing every month .
The underlyingmomentum created by the Framework Programmes is a key component inour drive to create the European Research Area .
The European Research Area is about better coordinating our efforts at alllevels , ensuring European research addresses the needs of our citizens.Butputting research at the service of society requires society to developgreater involvement in and understanding of the scientific world .
So in the Fifth Framework Programme ( 1998-2002 ) , we launched a series of activities to support efforts to develop public knowledge of science .
The Raising Public Awareness activities , described in this brochure , were something of a pilot , enabling usto see how different approaches to raising public interest in science might work .
We supported two types of activity : one helped networks of science communicators from across Europe , while the second assisted in developing events and / or services targeting specific groups of the public.Theintention of all these activities has been to lower some of the barriers which surround science , makingit easier for interested non-scientists to gain an understanding of particular scientific topics .
Just asimportantly , these activities have aimed to demonstrate to those who do not feel interested in science thatthere are many reasons to look more closely , and that science is not an impenetrable world .
Special attentionmust go to Europe ’ s young people .
If Europe is to maintain and develop its place in the world as a leadingscience and technology-driven economy , we will need not only to continue training top-quality scientists butto raise a scientifically-aware society .
In this brochure we look at just a few of the 54 Raising Awareness projects supported over the past four yearsin the Fifth Framework Programme .
With these first activities we have demonstrated that such initiativescan succeed in reaching a new audience , and that they can bring excellent results in raising interest.Inthenew Sixth Framework Programme we will take a rather different approach to raising public awareness a more ambitious approach – even – but the underlying goal remains the same .
The examples outlined inthis brochure show what can be done , and should encourage those with ideas to explore the opportunitiesfor raising awareness activities within the Sixth Framework Programme .

Raising Public Awareness

Introducing Raising Public Awareness
The Raising Public Awareness activities formed a very small part of the Fifth Framework Programme ( FP5 ) , given that they represented the Commission s firststeps ’ in the area .
They tied in with a range of activities within the Improving Human Potential programme ‘ ’ , all aimed at ensuring Europe ’ s research ambitionsare matched with sufficient human resources .
Human resources are of crucial significance for European research .
The EU s leaders ’ haveestablished the objectives of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-basedeconomy “ in the world ” , and increasing research investment to 3 % of gross domestic product ( from1.9 % today ) by 2010 .
Significant numbers of additional researchers will be required if these goalsare to be met .
Europe will need somewhere between 500 000 and 1 million new scientists andengineers .
This is a formidable challenge , and extra money alone cannot overcome it .
“ The EU can play a major role in stimulating the Member States , setting the agenda in this area , ” says Dr Rainer Gerold , Director of Science and Society in the European Commission s Research DG ’ .
“ We have proposed a number of actions , new initiatives at European level , to stimulate interestin science as a career .
Basically three elements combine to make the challenge all the moredemanding : the additional need for scientists , the ageing population , and a decreasing interest in science . ”
“ Science has to be considered as an asset to society , as a way to improve standards of living and economic standing . ”
Subject matters
It is this last the decreasing interest – in science – which the Raising Public Awareness actions set out to address.Society appears to value scientists less than those who follow many other career paths , at least in terms of financialrewards .
As long as other careers deliver much greater returns , young people will tend to prefer them to science.Furthermore , scientific training is often seen as harder than that for other disciplines , and this may discourageyoung people from choosing science subjects ."

36th General Assembly of the Conference of Peripheral
Turning territorial diversity into strength Green Paper – on Territorial Cohesion adopted
A union of territories each boasting its own cultural traditions , natural resources , infrastructure , skills base , languages – the list goes on – the EU s diversity ’ is both a challenge and an opportunity .
The Commission ’ s new Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion , adopted 6 October , argues this territorial diversity is a vital asset , contributing to the sustainable development of the EU as a whole .
Representing more than 190 million people from coastal regions around Europe , 160 regions met at the CPMR general assembly to discuss a range of subjects including : energy and climate issues , territorial cohesion , the Lisbon Agenda and regional development , as well as the European integrated maritime policy .
The Green Paper , it is hoped , will spark debate and encourage people to put forward their opinions , the Regional Policy website has a page devoted to enabling contributions from the public , organisations and public authorities .
The pattern of settlement in the EU is unusual , there are around 5 000 towns and almost 1 000 cities spread across Europe .
Although the urban network is relatively dense , only 7 % of the population live in cities of over 5 million as opposed to 25 % in the US .
All this means that although urban life is a widespread feature , it is not a concentrated one : city dwellers live close to rural areas and rural residents often live within easy reach of services .
' The [ ] paper … demonstrates our commitment to engaging in a real public debate on the signicance of territorial cohesion for the design and implementation of community policies ' , Hübner adds .
European Investment Bank ( EIB ) – 50 years of service
Economic activity is more uneven and there continues to be heavily congested urban areas and others with untapped potential .
A summary of the consultation will be published in the months following the end of the debate in February , 2009 .
http : / / ec.europa.eu / regional _ policy / consultation / terco / index _ en.htm http : / / ec.europa.eu / regional _ policy / consultation / terco / consultation _ en.htm
Territorial cohesion , the Green Paper explains , is about ensuring the harmonious development of all Europe s regions ’ .
“ Increasingly , competitiveness and prosperity depend on the capacity of the people and businesses located there to make the best use of all territorial assets ” , which is where public policy can play a major part , helping communities :
• respond jointly to common challenges such as climate change and globalisation ;
Growing investment needs confront public authorities while available resources get more scarce , underlining the need to use available funding as eciently as possible and find complementary sources of funding to fill short falls .
These and other subjects were discussed by delegates at the EIB s 50thanniversary conference ’ in Bratislava , 15-16 October .
Speakers included European Commissioner Danuta Hübner , Minister Ján Počiatek , CEOs of partner institutions as well as EIB managers and experts .
• reach critical mass and realise increasing returns by combining their activities ; http : / / www.eib.org /
• exploit the way territories can complement each other ; and
Outermost regions , Europe s hidden treasure ’ ‘ ’
• overcome divisions stemming from administrative borders .
The proposal puts up for debate the argument that Cohesion Policy needs to consider new themes , new forms of cooperation and new partnerships .
Many issues do not respect borders and frontiers .
They need a coordinated response from various regions including those neighbouring the EU .
Existing Cohesion Policy works well when dealing with ‘ place based challenges ’ such as regional development but doesn t ’ mesh well enough with other policies .
Announcing a shift in EU strategy for the outermost regions of the EU , Commissioner Dauta Hübner called the islands , “ Regions of opportunity ” .
Guadeloupe , French Guiana , Réunion , Martinique , the Azores , Madeira and the Canaries are European assets , explained the Commissioner .
The islands occupy positions of strategic importance , both in terms of maritime boundaries and for neighbour-hood relations .
In 2007-13 , € 7.8 billion will fund programmes dealing with the new challenges of climate change , demographic shifts and migration .

“ I am convinced that the debate on territorial cohesion can help us improve the policies contributing to the competitiveness of our territories , the well-being of our citizens and the quality of our environment , ” explains Danuta Hübner , Commissioner for Regional Policy .

The future of biodiversity research
Economics and policy in biodiversity
The European Platform for Biodiversity Research Strategy was established in 1999 with the aim of improving the effectiveness and relevance of European biodiversity research .
In Europe , as elsewhere , understanding and responsible management of biodiversity becomes ever more critical .
European research and its applications will be vital to preserve the unspoilt habitats , and to restore and manage habitats under stress .
Areas of biodiversity requiring focused research include : • Inventory - Improving the taxonomy and systematics of many groups , paying particular attention to endangered species ; • Monitoring - A network for long-term biodiversity is required ;
• Genetic variation - Breakthroughs in DNA technology will be invaluable when applied to understanding ecosystem structure , function and resilience ;
• Quality of habitats - Methods of monitoring habitat quality are needed , including supervising the impact of management ;
The platform aims to contribute to : • EU biodiversity research strategies and priorities including issues that might be addressed within Framework Programmes ; • Dissemination of best practice and understanding of biodiversity ; Exchange • of information regarding biodiversity ; • Essential biodiversity research in key European ecosystems ; and • Research to support and improve management plans for [ protected ] areas , including Natura 2000 .
Demonstrating the myriad approaches to biodiversity research , an FP5 project team is developing an economic framework and hypotheses for the consideration of incentive mechanisms for biodiversity provision .
The application of this to biodiversity case studies will assess its robustness and create a platform for investigating the impact of policy on biodiversity conservation .
This research will help policy makers understand the impact of individual policies and assist them in developing legislation and initiatives with the greatest efficacy in biodiversity conservation and management .
• Habitat loss and fragmentation - Enhanced understanding of the impact of loss and fragmentation is needed ;
Bringing together researchers and policymakers from throughout Europe , the platform operates under the rotating EU presidency , and biannual ' European Platform for Biodiversity ' meetings are hosted on specific themes .
• Biological invasion - Research is required to understand the impact of invasive organisms , including genetically modified organisms ;
• Economic drivers in biodiversity loss - Understanding and quantification of the impact of habitat loss and conservation is critical in undertaking effective biodiversity management ; and

EU-27 trade with CARICOM countries in 2006
Gas shipments to Spain explain massive increase in Trinidad and Tobago s ‘ import share
Trade remained stable between 2002 and 2006 – The Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago are the key partners
The EU-27 exported goods worth EUR 3.3 bn to the CARICOM countries in 2006 , 6.5 % less than a year earlier , but 3.5 % more compared to 2004 .
In all but one year of the period between 2000 and 2006 the highest share of exports went to the Bahamas ; in 2006 , their value amounted to close to 31 % of the total EU-27 exports to CARICOM .
Trinidad and Tobago as well as Jamaica followed with shares of 15 % and 10 % respectively .
All other CARICOM countries registered shares under 10 % .
As regards EU-27 imports from CARICOM , the Bahamas were overtaken by Trinidad and Tobago in 2006 .
The value of goods from the latter country increased more than two and a half fold between 2005 and 2006 , essentially due to Spanish imports of liquefied natural gas .
Trinidad and Tobago ’ s share stood at 32 % of the total EU-27 imports from CARICOM , ahead of the 27 % share registered for the Bahamas .
EU-27 trade with the Caribbean Community and Common Market ( CARICOM ) is fairly limited in absolute terms : this group of countries was responsible for 0.6 % of EU-27 s global exports ’ ( EUR 3.3 bn ) and 0.9 % of the global imports ( EUR 3.9 bn ) in 2006 .
Trade remained fairly constant between 2000 and 2006 , as the trade balance fluctuated between a surplus of EUR 0.7 bn ( 2003 ) and a deficit of EUR 0.6 bn ( 2006 ) , with near balance registered in 2001 and 2005 .
The Bahamas , Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica are the main trading partners among the CARICOM group of countries .
Among the EU Member States , Spain and the United Kingdom are the most important traders , both for exports and imports .
Spain is the top importer with a share close to 30 % of the total due to a large import of liquefied natural gas from Trinidad and Tobago .

Conversely , Italy , France , and , to a lesser extent , Germany lost ground as the value of their exports between 2000 and 2006 decreased by an average 15 % per year ( 8 % for Germany ) .
Imports from CARICOM countries went mainly to four EU Member States : Spain ( 29 % of total imports due mainly to gas ) , France ( 19 % ) , the UK ( 17 % ) and Germany ( 12 % ) .
Spain emerged as the main EU exporter to CARICOM countries .
Between 2000 and 2006 , the value of goods originating from Spain increased by an average 22.3 % per year and amounted to EUR 658 million in 2006 , ahead of the United Kingdom with exported goods worth EUR 607 million .
The most impressive relative increases were found among certain new Member States ( especially Latvia and Bulgaria ) but in absolute terms , their volumes remain small .

The business enterprise is the foundation for economic development .
In furthering European integration , the EIB places a special emphasis on strengthening industrial competitiveness , supporting the activities of small and medium sized businesses , and improving infrastructure on which business enterprises depend .
As a key player in both the economy and society , stimulating development through investment and creating added value through innovation , the business enterprise is at the forefront of all economic activity and takes pride of place among the vari ­ ous recipients of European Investment Bank financing .

service sector ( 2.5 billion ) , it is chiefly tourism ( 1 billion ) and private and publicsector services ( 908 million ) that have benefited from EIB funds .
The ElB 's task is to foster European integra ­ tion .
This is reflected in its objectives , underpinning Community policies , namely : strengthening industry 's international com ­ petitiveness and its integration at Euro ­ pean level , supporting SMEs through glo ­ bal loans , promoting development in less favoured regions , expanding and modern ­ ising trans ­ European transport and tele ­ communications networks , protecting the environment and improving the quality of life ( including urban development ) and safeguarding energy supplies .
These objectives accommodate the needs of business enterprises , in terms both of their own investment and that designed to improve the infrastructure on which their activities depend .

To accommodate an increase in staff reflecting the widening scope of the ElB 's role , an extension is being added to the Bank 's Luxembourg headquarters .
As a Community financial institution and leading borrower on the capital markets , it is vital for the EIB to maintain its credit rating .
Indeed , the quality of its project portfolio , its financial structure and its "" shareholders "" - the Member States of the Community - form the basis for this high credit rating .
Thus it is in a position to mobilise a very large volume of resources on the keenest terms available .
The EIB Prize insert
During the last five years , the EIB has granted loans worth 58.8 billion ECU ( 15.3 billion in 1991 alone ) , of which 52.1 billion within the Community .
More particularly , 18 billion has gone into investment in industry , services and agriculture , either in the form of individual loans to enterprises for large ­ scale projects ( 9.4 billion ) or by way of global loans on ­ lent by banks or other financial intermediaries and intended to facilitate capital investment by SMEs ( 8.6 billion ) .
The main sectors attract ­ ing funds include transport equipment ( 3 billion ) , chemicals ( 2 billion ) , metalworking and mechanical engineering ( 1.7 billion ) , foodstuffs ( 1.7 billion ) , pulp and printing ( 1.5 billion ) , and electronics ( 906 million ) .

Since 2008 , Cedefop has coordinated the study visits programme foreducation and vocational training specialists and decision-makers , one of thekey actions of the European lifelong learning programme ( 2007-13 ) .Cedefopʼs success in managing study visits for vocational education andtraining ( VET ) specialists for more than 20 years has been acknowledgedand it is a stimulating challenge to embark on coordinating a transversalprogramme that includes all fields of education and training .
It has workedout well and as we expected , brought new opportunities for developing theprogramme in bringing together VET , general , higher and adult educationinto a lifelong learning perspective .
The study visits programme is an effective platform for education andtraining policy development and cooperation in Europe .
The programmeprovides excellent opportunities for discussion and knowledge-sharing , exchanging ideas and practices , networking and future cooperation for awide spectrum of education and vocational training specialists and policymakers , including social partners .
This publication presents findings of about 100 study visits 2008 / 09related to improving quality and efficiency , which is one of the priorities of thestrategic framework for European cooperation in education and training ( ʻET2020ʼ ) , and more specifically , its three thematic components : acquisition ofkey competences , challenges for teachers and trainers and new approachesto leadership and management .
Outcomes of exchanges that take placeduring study visits are recorded in group reports and bring a lot of interestingand relevant information to policymakers and experts working in the field , especially practical examples of implementation of policies at national , regional and local levels .
Cedefop has set a priority to capture , assess and disseminate theoutcomes of study visits to wider audiences .
This publication shows thatoutcomes of study visits have strong potential for informing policycooperation and development .
In cooperation with key actors at Europeanand national levels , Cedefop is committed to stimulate further reflection anddebate through analysis of practices and common learning on issues at European level and to disseminate this knowledge .
We hope this publicationwill also contribute to building bridges among educational and VETinstitutions and developing interesting cooperation projects .

IHTROBUCTIOS
The main feature of the changed pattern of consumer demand for fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe in the years following the end of the second World War was a considerable increase in consumption per capitat reflecting the upward movement of incomes .
This seemed to indicate a high level of inoome elasticity of demand for these products .
The overall increase in consumption involved a certain number of product substitutions , with a tendency to move up the scale of quality .
Thus , potatoes first took over from the more traditional root vegetables , and then it was the turn of potatoes and dried vegetables to be replaced by green vegetables .
By 1965 — 70f however , it was evident that overall demand for fresh fruit and vegetables was tending to level off , and this development has been followed in the past few years by a marked fall in average consumption per head of population .
It can thus be assumed that after a period of quantitative expansion this sector of the food market has entered a far more quality-conscious phase in which consumers will attach greater priority to the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the produce under study .
Furthermore , the new pattern of distribution , with supermarkets taking an increased share in total sales , is changing the consumer / product relationship at the moment of purchase .
The trend is towards consumer decisions based on a reference number or a distinctive trade mark rather than on the sort of personal judgment which is becoming increasingly difficult to make .
Page 8
This report is an attempt to collate the available information on the objective parameters for defining the organoleptic properties of these products so as to make them known to consumers by means of an identification mark or an informative label , and to put forward general conclusions that are valid for all the Member Countries of the European Community .
The report also contains comprehensive information about the effects of environmental factors , cultural techniques and methods of storage and marketing insofar as they affect the production of top quality fruit and vegetables and the preservation of that quality after harvesting .
The study was undertaken as part of the programme of the Directorate-General for Agriculture of the Commission of the European Communities .
The author , Monsieur Jean THIAULT , is Chief Agronomic Engineer at the Centre Technique du Genie Rural des Eaux et des Forêts ( which falls under the aegis of the French Ministry of Agriculture ) at Aix-en-Provence .

Introducing the Eurobarometer
Eurobarometer public opinion surveys ( "" standard Eurobarometer surveys "" ) have been conducted on behalf of the Directorate-General for Information , Communication , Culture , Audiovisual of the European Commission each spring and autumn since autumn 1973 .
They have included Greece since autumn 1980 , Portugal and Spain since autumn 1985 , the former German Democratic Republic since autumn 1990 and Austria , Finland and Sweden from spring 1995 onwards .
An identical set of questions was asked of representative samples of the population aged fifteen years and over in each Member State .
The regular sample in standard Eurobarometer surveys is 1000 people per country except Luxembourg ( 500 ) and the United Kingdom ( 1000 in Great Britain and 300 in Northern Ireland ) .
In order to monitor the integration of the five new Länder into unified Germany and the European Union , 2000 persons have been sampled in Germany since Eurobarometer 34 : 1000 in East Germany and 1000 in West Germany .
In each of the 15 Member States , the survey is carried out by national institutes associated with the "" INRA ( Europe ) European Coordination Office "" .
This network of institutes was selected by tender .
All institutes are members of the "" European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research "" ( ESOMAR ) and comply with its standards .
The figures shown in this report for each of the Member States are weighted by sex , age , region and size of locality .
The figures given for the European Union as a whole are weighted on the basis of the adult population in each country .
In certain cases , the total percentage in a table does not always add up exactly to 100 % , but a number very close to it ( e.g. 99 or 101 ) , because of rounding .
When questions allow for several responses , percentages often add up to more than 100 % .
Percentages shown in the graphics may display a difference of 1 % compared to the tables because of the way previously-rounded percentages are added .
This report , which was drawn up by the Public Opinion Analysis Unit ( X.A.2 ; Head of Unit : Anna Melich ) of the Directorate-General for Information , Communication , Culture , Audiovisual , is an internal working document of the European Commission .
Types of surveys in the Eurobarometer series
The European Commission ( Directorate General X ) organises general public opinion , specifìc target group , as well as qualitative ( group discussion , in-dëpth interview ) surveys in all Member States and , occasionally , in third countries .
There are four different types of polls available :
Traditional standard Eurobarometer surveys with reports published twice a year Telephone Flash EB , also used for special target group surveys ( e.g. Top Decision Makers ) Qualitative research ( "" focus groups "" ; in-depth interviews ) In the near future : Eurobarometer Applicant Countries ( replacing the Central and Eastern EB )
The face-to-face general public standard Eurobarometer surveys and the future EB Applicant Countries surveys , the telephone Flash EB polls and qualitative research serve ' primarily to carry out surveys for the different Directorates General and comparable special services of the Commission on their behalf and on their account .

Jobs in Europe : confidence amidst uncertainty
Jobs in Europe : confidence amidst uncertainty depends critically on maintaining the level of GDP growth , and challenges in continuing the process of structural change remain .
• Youth unemployment fell sharply during the year , by some three times more than for adults , a decline of some 4 percentage points since the peak .
• Economic growth continued modestly in 1998 , at 2.9 % and is expected to grow modestly again in 1999 at 2.1 % .
• Employment expanded strongly in 1998 , by 1.8 million , or 1.2 % , to bring total employment to 151 million and the employment rate to 61 % .
• Long-term unemployment fell little in 1998 , the rate falling by only a third of a percentage point to 4.9 % of the labour force and the share remaining at 49 % of the total unemployed .
The proportion unemployed for two years or more also rose to 31 % , or 62 % of all long-term unemployed .
The Employment in Europe report 1999 presents the latest trends in employment and the labour market and provides the analytical back ground to the review of the employ ment strategy and the adoption of the Employment Guidelines for 2000 .
The immediate outlook is one of confidence — based on the launch of EMU and the strengthened job creation process — tinged with uncertainties at the global level .
The start of a process towards a Euro pean Employment Pact , combining the strengths of the employment and macroeconomic strategies , can only tip the balance further towards a healthier labour market in Europe with more and better jobs for all those who wish to work .
Employment rises but remains below 1991 peak
Recent developments — the stylised facts
Employment of men increased significantly for the first time in the present recovery , almost half of the net additional jobs going to men ; the share of women in employment , however , rose further to 42 % and the gender gap in the employ ment rate declined to just under 20 percentage points .
• More permanent jobs than temporary ones were created in 1998 , but the latter still made up over 40 % of the increase in employment and now account for ^ VWc of all jobs .
Unemployment fell further in 1998 to an average of 10 % for the year as a whole , a decline of over 1 million during the year .
From the summer of 1998 , the recovery of the Union economy lost momentum ."

Rail transport
Transporting the future
Building up steam : a single rail market
Funding for the Seventh Framework Programme ( FP7 ) is set to rise dramatically in view of the EU s enlargement , and transport ’ is one of its main thematic priorities .
Beginning in 2007 , the new FP7 s ’ transport research goals include :
Europe has long benefited from a dense railway network and is the world leader in the supply of railway systems .
Employing 1 million people in rail operations and another 250 000 in manufacturing , the European railway sector has a 60 % share of the world market and an annual turnover of € 95 billion .
• the greening of surface transport ( reduction of environmental and noise pollution , clean and efficient power trains , use of alternative fuels for transport ) ;
• intermodal shifts and the decongestion of transport corridors ( development of intermodal networks , information exchanges between vehicle / vessel and transport infrastructures ) ;
Though it spends some 2 billion € on research each year , more investment is needed to modernise rolling stock , exploit new business techniques and create intelligent integrated logistics systems , such as roll-on / roll-off interfaces , for Europe s road and waterborne sectors ’ .
These are all targets of EU-funded research .
• sustainable urban mobility ( new public transportation modes , integrated town planning and transport ) ;
• stronger competitiveness ( component , vehicle and infrastructure technologies ; cost-effective production systems and infrastructure construction ; improved design processes ) .
SURFACE TRANSPORT
Rail transport offers a viable and competitive means of shifting more cargo traffic away from the continent ’ s crowded roads , thus improving traffic circulation and cutting vehicle-emitted pollution .
The EU places particular emphasis on stimulating new investment in trans-European transport infrastructure such as rail , and its current Sixth and forthcoming Seventh Framework Programmes support research efforts to create new methods of interoperability , higher safety standards and the reduction of rail-related noise levels .
The EU ’ s recently launched MODTRAIN project brings together , for the first time , all the main European rail system manufacturers , sub-system suppliers and rail operators .
Working towards interoperability of national rolling-stock systems and sub-systems , MODTRAIN offers a radical approach to rolling-stock construction .
Its goal of reducing the number of single components in a railway carriage from 1 200 to 120 parts and cutting construction time by more than 50 % should give a huge boost to the sector ’ s competitiveness. www.modtrain.com
Such projects of technological excellence will lead to a cleaner , safer and more secure transport environment for Europe s citizens ’ .
And they will strengthen business and industry , thus helping the EU achieve its Lisbon Agenda goals of strong job creation and economic growth .

To date about 425 forms detailing centres of excellence either have been received from the Member States or have been gathered in another way , covering all mandated areas of Europol and law enforcement techniques .
A high standard of security and confidentiality is assured .
Access to the Knowledge Management Centre , including details of contact persons , is restricted only to the directory manager .
Information and contact details marked as ' confidential ' will never be exchanged without prior permission of the provider .
Some examples of registered items are :
Introduction
• sophisticated surveillance with use of modern equipment such as beacons and satellite-tracking devices ;
The Knowledge Management Centre of Europol provides a 24-hour on-call service .
It is also available to the Member States in cases where expertise is required but it has not yet been registered .
In such an instance , an active search will be initiated to meet the applicant 's request .
• experts in the field of interviewing ( mentally disabled persons , vulnerable or young victims / witnesses ) , use of interpreters for the deaf ( interrogating , questioning and other communicative support ) ;
The Knowledge Management Centre is more than just a collection of addresses and contact points .
It should offer a strong tool for law enforcement cooperation ( police and customs ) and prevent duplication of effort by users .
• forensic hypnosis and analytical interviewing according to international approved guidelines ;
In accordance with the ' intelligence concept ' , Europol 's objectives and tasks include playing a proactive role in providing its partners and future users with useful expertise .
This role will include provision of an international search facility which can give added value in various ways , not only via information exchange , but also via the central storage of expertise and other forms of information of common interest to Member States .
Please do not hesitate to contact the Knowledge Management Centre should you require further information or assistance .
• three-dimensional visualisation and animation of crime scenes ;
Knowledge management
• scene recording and mapping ( applicable for air- and railway traffic accident scenes and crime scenes .
The exact location of a crime scene can be illustrated and adjusted in detail ) ;
Serious Crime Department Intelligence Management Unit Knowledge Management Centre
• biological traces ( morphology , anatomy and taxonomy of different biological materials ) ;
• printing identification ;
Knowledge management , which is the future concept for efficient cross-border cooperation when combating serious crime , cannot be properly carried out between relevant partners and / or criminal investigators without establishing a comprehensive EU-wide ' Knowledge Management Centre ' .
Available new technology further creates higher user expectations and demands fast and easy access to relevant expertise .

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Knowledge Unit
European Commission support for research and technological development ( RTD ) is centred on a series of Framework programmes , which define the focal areas for activities to be undertaken , and provide the funds necessary for their execution .
The dissemination of information is seen to be an integral part of the research process , and is carried out partly by the specific RTD programmes and partly through centralised actions known as the VALUE programmes , which also cover measures to aid the exploitation and utilisation of the research results .
The Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Knowledge Unit of DG XIII / D-2 is responsible for operating the part of the VALUE programme concerned with the dissemination of information on Community RTD activities and their results , and the promotion of the uptake and application of these results .
This is achieved through a variety of publications , and electronically through the CORDIS ( Community Research and Development Information Service ) databases .
The Unit also manages the RTD Help Desk which offers assistance in locating sources of detailed information ( such as publications and contact persons ) concerning the research activities of the European Commission .
Enquiries are accepted by letter , telephone or fax .
Regular news and information updates are provided by a variety of publications , including annual and sectoral catalogues of RTD publications , a guide to sources of information on Community RTD known as the Infoguide , the Innovation and Technology Transfer newsletter , and the Progress in Coal , Steel and Related Social Research journal , in addition to Euro Abstracts .
For further information , contact the RTD Help Desk at :

What is the European Convention for ?
It is composed of 105 membersrepresentingthe governments and national parliaments ofthe Member States and candidate countries , the European Parliament and the European Commission .
Each member of the Conventionhas an alternate .
A total of 13 observers representing the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , the socialpartners and the European Ombudsman areinvited .
In December 2000 , at their meeting in Nice , the 15 Heads of State or Government set intrain the process of debating the future ofthe European Union deeply and widely.A year later , with the adoption of the Laeken Declaration on the future of the European Union on 15 December 2001 , the European Council decided to convene a European Convention to pave the way for thereform of the Union .
The impetus for the Convention s work ’ is provided by a 12-member Praesidium .
The purpose of the European Convention isto propose a framework and structures forthe European Union which are geared tochanges in the world situation , the needs ofthe citizens of Europe and the future development of the Union .
What is the modus operandi ?
At the end of its work , sometime in 2003 , itwill submit its proposals for a constitutionaltreaty to the European Council .
An intergovernmental conference will thereaftertake the final decisions with a view to ratification by the Member States accordingto their respective constitutional procedures .
A programme of work in three phases : • A listening phase : identification of the expectations and needs of the Member States , their governments and parliaments , and those of European society . • A deliberating phase : comparison of the various opinions put forward and assessment of their implications and consequences .
Who are the members of the Convention ?
The Laeken European Council appointed Mr Valéry Giscard d Estaing ’ as Chairman ofthe Convention , and Mr Giuliano Amato and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as Vice-Chairmen .
The Convention brings together the mainparties involved in the debate on the futureof the Union .

PREFACE
This volume is part of an inquiry on the Spread and Characteristics of
Wage Payment Systems in the Member States of the Community carried out in the framework of the Foundation 's programme of work for 1979 as de cided by the Administrative Board of the Foundation .
The inquiry , comprising nine national surveys and one synthesis report , was a first step towards more detailed case studies on the impact of the various systems of pay , especially incentive schemes .
It was therefore aimed at providing the necessary background for these studies , which were undertaken as part of the Foundation 's work programmes for
1979 , 1980 and 1982 in accordance with decisions by the Administrative
Board .
On these grounds it was decided that the aims of the Foundation in carrying out the national surveys be as follows :
( i ) to give an overall picture of the existing wage payment systems in the nine countries , especially the incentive schemes ;
( ii ) to describe the developments during the last two decades and to indicate new trends ;
( iii ) to assess the impact of the various incentive payment schemes on working conditions and the work environment , production , workers ' income and the costs to the company , as well as the interrelationship between such systems and technology .
The inquiry was carried out in three phases :
1 ) a report was drawn up by a research institute in each Member State ;
2 ) a synthesis report based on the national reports was prepared by the Foundation ;
Page 8
3 ) the set of reports was evaluated by representatives of the govern ments , the employers and the trade unions .
Each group viewed the analysis contained in the reports against the experience of its respective members and , if appropriate , made proposals aimed at improving the situation .
Each group set down its opinion in the form of a written evaluation report .
This method reflects the Foundation 's regard for promoting research of a type which brings together the experts ' approach and the experience of those involved practically in problems of working conditions .
The above-mentioned aims were considered as maximum requirements and the expectations with regard to obtaining information on the impact on payment schemes were rather modest .
However , considering that the national surveys would serve as background information for further studies it was decided to include all information already available on this item .
The procedures followed in the inquiry on the Spread and Characteristics of Wage Payment Systems is reflected in the composition of this volume which contains :
1 ) the evaluation reports drawn up by representatives of governments , trade unions and employers , based on working group meetings at a seminar held in Dublin on 2 and 3 July 1981 ;
2 ) a study carried out by the University of Amsterdam , Department of Work and Organisational Psychology , on the Spread and Characteristics of Wage Payment Systems in the Netherlands ."

For some years now , Eurostat has been operating a free dissemination policy , o ering its products and services free of charge and with easy access via its website .
Right from the start in 2004 , the user support team has helped to put this policy into practice .
Over the years , however , both website and user support have undergone a number of modifications. cations .
Gunter Schäfer Head of Unit Dissemination Dissemination ‘ ’ ‘ ’
To increase the link to global current affairs , a new section on the homepage called ‘ In the spotlight ’ was created .
It lists existing statistics on topics of high topical interest which match the ‘ In the spotlight section ’ of the Europa site .
The statistical information covers the most relevant products offered by Eurostat : prede- fined tables , access to the database , metadata and publications .
To complete the information , other external sources are also provided .
The user friendliness of the Eurostat website functionalities has recently been improved with the implementation of ‘ TGM ’ ( tables , graphs and maps ) .
Following suggestions from users , Eurostat has implemented several online demo-tours ‘ ’ .
You can find these tours in the help / user support section of the Eurostat homepage .
A new tool for extracting data from the Eurostat statistical databases called ‘ data explorer ’ has been put on the website for experimental trial by users .
It aims at providing in the near future a single , easy-to-use interface to all Eurostat statistical databases .
It will replace the multitude of existing tools for extracting data from the different statistical databases .
A new type of statistical publication has been implemented during 2007 .
It consists of an electronic publication called ‘ DIF ’ ( Data in focus ) .
This publication contains data and graphs in addition to methodological notes .
Issues of Data in focus can be produced and published very rapidly .

Introduction tained in the Eurovoc thesaurus .
This thesaurus will be supplied to subscribers or users on request .
The catalogue of documents lists the COM Documents of the Commission of the European Communities , the Reports of the European Parliament and the Opinions and Reports of the Economic and Social Committee prepared during the reference period by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities for distribution to the public .
The index contains from one to five keywords for each document , set out in alphabetical order with as many permutations as there are keywords which makes research easier .
The keywords are followed by a reference number which refers to the sequence number in the catalogue ( see detailed explanation on page 7 ) .
The COM Documents and the Opinions of the ESC are available on paper and microfiche , whereas from 1 January 1990 , the Reports of the European Parliament are available only on microfiche .
Part III — The numerical index comprises all the documents in ascending numerical order , with the corresponding microfiche number .
Frequency and cumulation
This version of the catalogue takes account only of documents of which English language texts have been prepared .
There are parallel catalogues covering documents in each of the eight other official languages of the European Community .
Cumulative catalogues are published regularly .
These , together with an annual catalogue , complement the monthly lists which only contain the thematic index .
Presentation

Abstract :
In Europe , declining corporate tax rates have come along with rising tax-to-GDP ratios .
This paper explores to what extent income shifting from the personal to the corporate tax base can explain these diverging developments .
We exploit a panel of European data on firm births and legal form of business to analyze income shifting via increased entrepreneurship and incorporation .
The results suggest that lower corporate taxes exert an ambiguous effect on entrepreneurship .
The effect on incorporation is significant and large .
It implies that the revenue effects of lower corporate tax rates – possibly induced by tax competition -- partly show up in lower personal tax revenues rather than lower corporate tax revenues .
Simulations suggest that between 10 % and 17 % of corporate tax revenue can be attributed to income shifting .
Income shifting is found to have raised the corporate tax-to-GDP ratio by some 0.2 % -points since the early 1990s .
Keywords : Corporate tax ; Personal tax ; Entrepreneurship ; Incorporation ; Income shifting .

ABSTRACT
The origin of the uncertainty affecting Performance Assessments , as well as their propagation to dose and risk results is discussed .
The analysis is focused essentially on the uncertainties introduced by the input parameters , the values of which may range over some orders of magnitude and may be given as probability distribution function .
The paper briefly reviews the existing sampling techniques used for
Monte Carlo simulations and the methods for characterizing the output curves , determining their convergence and confidence limits .
Annual doses , expectation values of the doses and risks are computed for a particular case of a possible repository in clay , in order to illustrate the significance of such output characteristics as the mean , the logarithmic mean and the median , as well as their ratios .
The report concludes that provisionally , due to its better robustness , such estimation as the 90th percentile may be substituted to the arithmetic mean for comparison of the estimated doses with acceptance criteria .
In any case , the results obtained through Uncertainty
Analyses must be interpreted with caution as long as input data distribution functions are not derived from experiments reasonably reproducing the situation in a well characterized repository and site .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years probabilistic analyses have been introduced in perfor mance assessment studies on the feasibility of repositories for the geological disposal of radioactive waste .
These probabilistic analy ses take into account the considerable uncertainties , which arise when the behaviour of the complex disposal system is predicted over long time periods ."

THE CONVERTED BLAST FURNACE
INTRODUCTION
Hoogovens IJmuiden and British Steel Technical , Teesside Laboratories , have developed an Iron Smelting process , we called the Converted Blast Furnace .
It is characteristic for this process that liquid iron is being produced - without coke ; - with coal as energy raw material ; - making use of an existing ironmaking installation .
1.1 Without coke
The most important drawbacks of cokemaking are as follows :
- High installation cost of the intricate refractory construc tion . - High maintenance costs , significantly higher than usual for metallurgical installation . - Emissions of dust and noxious gases at charging and pushing of the ovens .
Recent developments have markedly improved the latter two points , however by still further increasing the construction costs .
Therefore Hoogovens and British Steel have developed a process not using coke .
We reasoned as follows : If from today no new coking capacity would be built the coke production would be reduced to zero in
3 5 years .
Then for the production of the same quality of iron the consumption per tonne must be reduced from 500 kg / THM to zero .
A reduction to 250 kg / THM would suffice us till the year
That may be achieved by the injection of 2 00-3 00 kg of coal per THM at the tuyeres of the blast furnace .
Therefore British Steel and Hoogovens are engaged in a demon stration project for the injection of up to 4 00 kg / THM coal at a blast furnace at Teesside .
This programme is backed up by plant trials in Britain and the"
