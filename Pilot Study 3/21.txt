Article 11 If the purchase or sales of assets by a listed company or the company it controls or controlled by it meets one of the following standards, a material assets reorganization is constituted:
(1) Total assets purchased or sold account for not less than 50% of the total assets in the audited consolidated financial statement of the last fiscal year of the listed company;

If the assets purchased or sold do not reach the aforesaid stipulated standards, but the CSRC finds that there may be major issues that could damage the legitimate rights and interests of the listed company or the investors, according to the principle of prudent supervision, it can order the listed company to disclose extra relevant information, suspend the transaction and submit application documents.
Article 12 The following stipulations shall be followed when calculating the percentages stated in the previous article:
（1）If the assets purchased are equity, the total amount of the assets is the product of the total amount of the assets of the invested enterprise and the equity percentage of the investment or the transaction amount, whichever is higher; the business income is the product of the business income of the invested enterprise and the equity percentage of the investment; net assets amount is the product of the total net assets of the invested enterprise and the equity percentage of the investment or the transaction amount, whichever is higher;
if the assets sold are equity, the total assets, business income and net assets are respectively the product of total assets, business income and net assets of the invested enterprise and the equity percentage of the investment.
If the purchase of the assets causes the listed company to have the controlling equity of the invested enterprise, the total amount of the assets is the total amount of the assets of the invested enterprise or the transaction amount, whichever is higher; the business income is the business income of the invested enterprise, and the net assets are the net assets of the invested enterprise or the transaction amount, whichever is higher; if the sales of the assets causes the listed company to lose the control right of the invested enterprise, the total assets, business income and net assets are respectively the total assets, business income and net assets of the invested enterprise.
（2）If the assets purchased are non-equity assets, the total amount is the book value of the assets or the transaction amount, whichever is higher, and the net value of assets is the difference between the related assets and the book value of the liabilities or the transaction amount, whichever is higher;
if the assets sold are non-equity assets, the total assets and the net assets are respectively the book value of the assets and the difference between the related assets and the book value of the liabilities;
if the non-equity assets do not involve liabilities, the standard for net assets stipulated in Clause (3) of the previous Article does not apply.
（3）If the listed company purchases and sells assets at the same time, relevant percentages of the assets purchase and sales shall be calculated separately, and the higher percentage of the two applies.
However, assets transaction activities that have been submitted to and approved by the CSRC in accordance with the provisions of the Measures do not need to be included in the accumulative calculation.
If the assets for transaction are owned or controlled by the same dealing party, or are in the same or similar business scope, or fall within other circumstances recognized by the CSRC, they can be deemed as the same or related assets.
