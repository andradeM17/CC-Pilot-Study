Well, you done, done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it to get my turn To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind, and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just on big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear And I will nibble your ear
I've been spent away to long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew in a face and laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid your self of vanitisies and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind, and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
I look into your heart and you'll find that The sky is yours
So please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
I'm yours
