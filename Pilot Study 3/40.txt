Quantum mechanics proposes that there is not just one universe.
There are multiple universes.
One of them is a parallel universe similar to earth civilization.
This area is covered by ocean.
People built Wuji City on the largest island.
While the desperadoes and rovers drifted on the sea, and turned into pirates.
Due to the backwardness of technological civilization and the lack of resources for survival, people started the legendary new land exploration journey.        
Thus, the hot-blooded sailing adventure era begun.
But no one has ever arrived.
In the face of the reality of broken legends, the pirates aimed at the resource plunder, conquering non-stop.
Invade Wuji City and plunder everything they have.
Tomorrow, it will be your turn to be coastguards.
Kill all the coastguards.
We, as the last righteous army on this continent, must win this battle and protect Wuji City.
Now the North Sea Yama has led all his pirate ships out to invade our waters and point their swords at our Wuji City.
The situation is grim and not optimistic.
Take up your weapons.
Get ready for battle!
[The Warlord of The Sea]
I've given the strategic plan to Luo Li.
Now it's up to Luo Li to give you the deployment.
Geese formation.
Change the formation.
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Ignite!
- Fire! - Fire!
Get down!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Everyone, side sail forty-five degrees.
Machine prepare.
Machine ready.
Stop!
The ships come from the left, and you made left full rudder.
Are you looking for a collision?
Right, right full rudder.
Now it's force 6 northwest wind, with all the points of action at our stern.
If we make the right full rudder, the left deflection moment caused by the wind plus the lateral force of the accompanying current will make us unable to move at all.
Their ships are downwind.
They will ram us to pieces.
Launch!
Get up!
Everyone get up!
Sacrifice them to the sea!
For the sake of Wuji City.
Kill them!
Look!
