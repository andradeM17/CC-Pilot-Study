The modern web has quickly become a viable platform not only for creating stunning, high quality games, but also for distributing those games. 
The range of games that can be created is on par with desktop and native OS counterparts. With modern Web technologies and a recent browser, it’s entirely possible to make stunning, top-notch games for the Web. 
And we’re not talking about simple card games or multiplayer social games that have in the olden days been done using Flash®. 
We’re talking about 3D action shooters, RPGs, and more. Thanks to massive performance improvements in JavaScript just-in-time compiler technology and new APIs, you can build games that run in the browser (or on HTML5-powered devices) without making compromises.

You can truly think of the Web as a better target platform for your game. 
As we like to say, “the Web is the platform.”
