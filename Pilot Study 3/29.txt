Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
How beautiful is the Princess Salome tonight!
THE PAGE OF HERODIAS
Look at the moon.
How strange the moon seems!
She is like a woman rising from a tomb.
She is like a dead woman.
One might fancy she was looking for dead things.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
She has a strange look.
She is like a little princess who wears a yellow veil, and whose feet are of silver.
She is like a princess who has little white doves for feet.
One might fancy she was dancing.
THE PAGE OF HERODIAS
She is like a woman who is dead.
She moves very slowly.
Noise in the banqueting-hall.
FIRST SOLDIER
What an uproar!
Who are those wild beasts howling?
SECOND SOLDIER
The Jews.
They are always like that.
They are disputing about their religion.
FIRST SOLDIER
Why do they dispute about their religion?
SECOND SOLDIER
I cannot tell.
They are always doing it.
The Pharisees, for instance, say that there are angels, and the Sadducees declare that angels do not exist.
FIRST SOLDIER
I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
How beautiful is the Princess Salome to-night!
THE PAGE OF HERODIAS
You are always looking at her.
You look at her too much.
It is dangerous to look at people in such fashion.
Something terrible may happen.
THE YOUNG SYRIAN
She is very beautiful to-night.
The Tetrarch has a sombre aspect.
Yes; he has a sombre aspect.
FIRST SOLDIER
He is looking at something.
SECOND SOLDIER
He is looking at some one.
FIRST SOLDIER
At whom is he looking?
