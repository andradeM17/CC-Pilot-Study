"So first off, Bard top. What a pick, I know right? Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like. *my core is static/ie/RFC. Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way. I like to safely clear and lay out poke. Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer. Giving some more tank… Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen. In this section is a few situations for more sustain. I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade. This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great. If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy. I’m yet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…"
"Complaints of Russian language use in Ukraine rise 30% - RT Russia & Former Soviet Union Authorities are urging the population to file reports in a bid to de-Russify the country The number of complaints to authorities in Ukraine of a person speaking in Russian increased by 30% last year. Kiev actively encourages the population to report such cases in a bid to allegedly 'protect' the country from Russian influence. According to the office of the commissioner for the protection of the state language, 3,692 language law violations were reported in 2023. Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa remain ""leaders in terms of the number of complaints of violations. Therefore, strict controls over the observance of the language rights of citizens in all spheres of public life should be among the priorities of community leaders this year,"" Taras Kremen, the country's Language Ombudsman said. Kremen also confirmed that a 3,400 hryvnia ($89) fine had been imposed on a Kiev taxi driver who serviced his clients in Russian. The ombudsman reminded the public of a ""detailed algorithm of actions in case of violation of the right to receive information or services in the state language,"" urging people to immediately file complaints on the commissioner's website when such cases occur. In 2019, Ukraine adopted a law that makes using the Ukrainian language obligatory in all spheres of public life, including government, medicine, science, education, and the media. Failure to comply can result in fines. Since 2022, when the military conflict with Russia began, Ukraine has undertaken a campaign of total de-Russification, with MPs saying it is necessary in order to defend against Russian influence. Local authorities have introduced complete bans on Russian-language works of art, performances, books, films, songs, and its study in schools and universities, and recommended that schoolchildren communicate in Ukrainian even during breaks. Last August, a teenage signer was briefly detained and forced to record a video apology following a performance of Soviet singer Viktor Tsoy's songs on the street in the city of Lviv. The dismissal of several teachers who spoke Russian to their students also resulted in a public outcry. The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Alexey Danilov, has previously said ""the Russian language must disappear"" from the territory of Ukraine ""as an element of hostile propaganda and brainwashing of the population."" Moscow maintains that such laws violate the rights of Russian-speaking people, who make up around half of Ukraine's population. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in February that Kiev's ""discriminatory campaign"" against the language was growing more and more ""indignant."" In a survey conducted last September by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology, respondents cited language discrimination as the most common type of prejudice in Ukraine, with 45% saying it was a problem."
"How do we get them to know they should use it? The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse... I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty. I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens. I want to own freedom... How do we change the landscape? What are your thoughts? Sorry for my English being bad."
"I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras. I have some questions and hope someone can help answer. 1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc. Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about? 2. Is there enough parking for the second car? 3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to? 4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ? It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place... I appreciate any advice I get."
"I went grocery shopping. I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes. Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop). Then I walked back and forgot my groceries. I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill. I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really. I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco. So I walked back and got them. No crime round these parts. Not much, anyway."
"Absolute rocket from from Stroud on a perfect half turn to goal. #DCU #MLS #MastodonFC Really tough not to buy that the league tells officials to help Miami when that’s not a penalty. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc Probably Pirani's best game this season, but he still just needs to be better. Like the aggressive call to sub him out for an offensive minded player like Fletcher. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc Amazing how there's two PKs #DCU should have had and got neither. The fix is so in for Miami #MLS #mastodonfc Well, perhaps ball doesn't lie. What an awful give away by Klich. Can't win when your DP plays that sloppy. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc Absolute meltdown. Obviously, the officiating hamstrung them, but the last twenty minutes are the play of the team that did not deserve to win. #DCU #MLS #mastodonfc Very curious to see how this #DCU team responds to a game that's best forgotten. They've had a bright start and sometimes bad games just happen, but they looked completely outclasses as the game went on. #MLS #mastodonfc @user7 who give a crap, go Badgers Women’s hockey! Hahaha @user8"
"When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also. I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners. However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it. So I’ve had enough. I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water. So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in... Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home."

"Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up. The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me. I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible. He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever. I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions. And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had. I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting. But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedly keep eating my food. I do that for maybe 3 seconds. Then I look back up. Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds."

"To evaluate the diagnostic yield of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided biopsy of retroperitoneal masses (RMs). Between 2006 and 2023, 87 patients presented at our US center for biopsy of an RM. In all biopsies, CEUS was performed prior to the intervention. The technical success rate of biopsy, the presence of diagnostic tissue in solid tumor biopsy samples, the accuracy of the biopsy and the occurrence of post-interventional complications were evaluated. A US-guided biopsy could be conducted in 84/87 cases (96.6%). In 3/87 cases (3.4%), US-guided biopsy was impossible because the planned needle path was obstructed by vital structures. Of 84 lesions, 80 (95.2%) were solid lesions, and 4 (4.8%) were lesions containing fluid. In all solid tumors, 80/80 (100%), diagnostic vital tissue was successfully obtained. CEUS-guided biopsy showed a sensitivity of 93.2%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, a negative predictive value of 72.2%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 94.2% for the differentiation between malignant and benign RMs. In one of the 84 cases (1.2%), there was a complication of postinterventional abdominal pain. Percutaneous CEUS-guided biopsy is a safe procedure with a high diagnostic yield and a low complication rate."
"You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere. And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is. She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!” She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak. Haha! Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what? Haha! She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl! You left the steak alone!” And that is the story of me being a good girl. Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt. She says she is dumb not to think of that. Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers."

"Will you marry me? You are crazy. Why am I crazy? I obey my impulses. Like the character in your book. I am the character in my book. But let's get back to our marriage. Now then, if we went around together for several months, the usual thing, you'd find out that I don't like carrots, and then you'd find out that I dunk my donuts. Exactly. It's twice as much fun marrying first and getting acquainted afterward."
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house. we will be moving out in 2mo. Once the papers are all finalzed. I have an Australian shepherd 9mo. My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo. We take her on play dates every other week. She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something. We take her to see a rat terrier. Thier play style is boxing. And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle. He doesnt like to play much infact he seems kinda scared too.
"We're not ready. And it's going to be more dangerous out there because you fired Greg. Because we don't have any money to pay him, Burt, you're doing this, not me. hell I am. Do you not understand what I had to do to get these kids out here? The bond that I had to put up for the insurance company, you want to lose all that? Rather than risk hurting one of the kids? Yeah. Why? Never bothered you before."
"I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP! Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!” The message repeats every time I hit enter. What the fuck! I’m not cheating. Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock. Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever. It tells me to turn off then refresh. I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player. 10/10 I’m never playing again. Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens."
"People go in the dark alone. No one could be THAT stupid! If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!

There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed! That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!"
We broke up 2 months ago. We had very little contact. But tmrw im no longer putting up with it. He would be the one to reach put all the time. I never reached out first. And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do. He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it. I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything. After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog. (He is deployed and his dog was his world) he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
In this hard economic times is very important to save money Very reasonable prices top quality work The owner operator he does all the the work with Helpers very friendly I definitely recommend this this guys Don't get jack by big companies that they pay alot of money to be on top of the list Thanks
"My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening. We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night. Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this. My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her. They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours. I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still wouldn't budge. Times are hard, I know, but they had no compassion. I called 3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back. I emailed 4 times, never a response. In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing. I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing. I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care."
"Are there any new Gaming console? I don't know should i buy PS3 or X-BOX Kinect. Or even N-DS or PSP. I'm a little afraid when i buy PS3 or X-BOX then a newer version comes out. ( Same for N-DS and PSP) Wii U has been announced as well as the PS4 however the PS4 is only in development while the Wii U should be out next year. Microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works. No matter when you buy you will get a newer version. I feel X-BOX is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years, its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the User Interface and the JOYSTICK....coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort. XBOX Joys are soo comfyy..... Performance - You get the same in all, just get a good TV. I don't know about the playstation situation but I do know that Microsoft has said they don't see the Xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime. Since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new Xbox so they don't plan on making another one for a while. I do know they have already announced a new wii though and I don't know what Sony has said about playstation but again, if you get an Xbox (which I personally think is the best anyways) you should be set for a while."
"BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER!!! It was the best Chinese food I have ever had. All the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome. The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly. Every time I go, Kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and I. Overall, it is very family oriented, and I recommend it to everyone!!!"
"When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11, I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager, Gustavo Guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner. I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda. Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle. He told me ""no problem, we will match the offer or do better."" Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems. Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world. I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus!!! Excellent customer service!!!"
"The Worst Chinese I've Ever Had This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had. The service stunk. I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses. They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again. They also got my friends order mixed up and wanted to charger her $10 more than what she had wanted. She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead. We were standing in the store for 20minutes to simply pick up an order. Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull. They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up. We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible. I dont know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that. The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable. I will NEVER go here again. Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal. I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote."
"Poor Service, Lack of Passion: Do NOT go I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services. The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office. It took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion (not that it's a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful). Also, I was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get Dr. Romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, I finally gave up and went to a different doctor. Please do not go there if it's professional, friendly, diligent medical services you're looking for. Save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility/doctor."
bearded dragon spikes? bit of a stupid question but do the spikes/spines (whatever you call them) on their side and face area ever go hard. or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them becca is right . iv owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and i handle mine all the time.. they dont go hard lik eneedle hard but they arnt pillow soft. they use them to look prickly.. would you try to eat a cactus [if u had no knife] i know i wouldnt. they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if ur holding them to tight :) Theyre not really hard. Beardies are actually quite delicate. I'm assuming it's to scare off predators / like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies. they dont hurt unless your stupid enough to press on them. They just are there as an adaptation.
"French dating etiquette? I would really love to hear what the French or those who had dated the French to say something about this. I'm in my 20's and currently studying in France. Coming from an anglo-saxon country my version of dating is 'getting the number, asking her out, etc..' However, I've read on the internet that the French dating etiquette is totally different. For them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off. In addition, from my understanding one-on-one dates is something that comes much later and not 'straight-away' like us anglo-saxons. They are also very secretive about being in a relationship. They only 'go out in the open' once they have reached a certain level of seriousness. Is it true? I have told a French girl I liked her, and she accepted. She is friendly when we see each other on campus. She is also nicer when we are both alone. However, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me. She also seems to hate it whenever I ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop! My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along. But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary. Have I just fallen victim in a cultural trap? What you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios. You are not French for a start, so the ""rules"" or ""customs"" may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds. From what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear. She is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out . She is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend. You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you. At parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent. Take the messages for what they are: she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further. ""Non!"" means ""non"", not ""I might consider it, and I will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case."" Christiane gave you a good answer. You have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding. What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you. She probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she doesn't want to go further. If she is nicer when you are alone I'd say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend. You do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts. Unfair for the girl as boys don't have that kind of handicap, but that's the way our own rules work. Should have done research before you left. Why not just take your chances and do it your way?"
"New Zealand skilled migrant visa? If you apply for a skilled migrant workers visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you can't find something in your own field. I have posted this question on the NZ visa site and can't get any info, does anyone know.??? Watch out the poles are coming.....my little butterfly That would be preferable but it doesn't matter, could be something similar It depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa. Your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector. If your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in New Zealand then you can work in any sector. It only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in New Zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa."
"yoga and horses.....? I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is. I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga. But there are just so many poses and programs! Any good poses or programs (I'm willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under $20) to help specifically with leg stabilization? I just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops. Because I don't feel like spending over $20 on a freakin DVD I also have back problems that transfer into my legs. I have done Yoga for riders for a while, a 20 minute routine I found on YouTube (I think its called ""Yoga for horse back riding"" hosted by a man) It helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way I use my legs and back. Here is what I do now and it really helps.... When I first get on I take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena. Then the same thing with the other leg. Then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as I can, so they are not touching the saddle. Then a lap doing scissors, one leg forward as far as I can and the other back, then switch legs. I'll also trot doing, down 2 beats, up one for a wile, then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet. If the weight is going into your heels (it throws your leg forward) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot. Do a nice working trot, not a slow trot. All this will help you use both legs evenly, keep proper contact and use your wight correctly, to keep your leg in a good position. BTW you dont want your leg locked in place, it will move WITH the horse a bit. When I first started doing it I'd do it every day. Now I just do it once or twice a week or as needed. Now not only is my leg better, but my back is relaxing. what are you having problems with? i wouldn't bother with yoga i'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem, ride bareback, with no irons, theres also a way to ride on your knees? that help alot with your thigh muscles (bareback though) ya i really wouldn't bother with the yoga maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and i've thought about getting one. with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps (on the ball of your foot) and balance to strengthen those muscles You don't want to spend more than $20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses? I really can't help you."
"What is Italian High Renaissance? Have a look at this, it may help. 1) The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600, marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe. The term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jacob Burckhardt. Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century. The word renaissance (Rinascimento in Italian) means “rebirth”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages. These changes, while significant, were concentrated in the elite, and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the Middle Ages. 2)The expression High Renaissance, in art history, is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardos fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the ""High Style"" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. [1] Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for over-simplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works. [2] Hope it helps!"
"Should all UK towns and their cafes or restaurants provide Halal food? Some friends of mine visited Dartmouth in Devon whilst on holiday last summer. They could not find any cafes or food shops that provided Halal prepared foods. Its important to their religion that they only consume Halal food. Even if you buy a cake in a bakers you can not be too what happens in the kitchen, for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham. Its simply not just a case of avoiding pork, alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat, but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods. Places like Dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions. We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday. Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch. Its not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them. I think its only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every British catering establishment will be halal. When I went to Bosnia, all the meat was Halal. I will not eat halal meat, so guess what, I opted for foods which weren't a meat dish, there were plenty of other options. I could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way I prefer to eat it. When you go to another country, you live by their way of life and their laws, if you don't like it, you know how to get back out the country (but I guess our benefits system is too much to throw away, huh). Cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway, they normally have blue for bakery items, red for cooked meat, brown for raw meat, etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies. No. To prevent animal cruelty, many countries forbid Halal and Kosher meat. Switzerland is one, and the Netherlands are passing the same law. It will become EU law in a couple of years. We can't dictate what business wants to open where. If someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places."
"Terrible service!!! Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate. They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate. When I called the manager to complain, she said she KNEW the guy didn't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier! Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead. So what was the point of the appointment!?! To just come over and hang out?!? I will NEVER do business with this company! EVER!!!"
"Beware of Sharayu Hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised. Apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts I could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint. My advise to all is I have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you dont!!!"
"what is a kimberwick bit used for? Used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking, hunting and doing cross country. It is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues. It is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins. The lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too. Useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently. For horses that are strong pullers. It just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure. It's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle. I know that's vague, but it depends on the horse. The rider needs to have independent hands as well, because you do NOT want to pull too hard on a bit like that. ;)"
"What are good B&W software's Photography? What are really good programs for smooth crisp Black & White editing? I use GIMP and Its not cutting it, looks terrible. Here's one of my shots in B&W http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamtolle/6094960940/in/set-72157627535453128/ Any programs that you use please list :) Thx You could also try this in gimp. It will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks: Open your image while it's still in color Create a new layer and fill the later with black. Set the layer mode to ""color"" this will make your image blak and white. Click colors>>>levels and adjust each channel's color values. This will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image. For more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/gimp-video-tutorial-how-to-convert.html For more information on adjusting exposure in gimp chef out this gimp video tutorial: http://gimpedblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/how-to-use-gimp-for-beginners-lesson-4.html Hope this helps. Picasa is free and pretty good. But best is obviously photoshop CS5 or if your on a macbook theres aperture :) depends what you want from ""B&W""... many programs will use a generic B&W... try something like photoscape which has different options..."
"What sort of Hotel could I expect to find in New Delhi/Agra/Varanasi for rs500 per night? Hey guys. I'm looking to visit India with some mates at the beginning of February next year and I am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for Rs 500 per person per night. There would be four of us so we would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for Rs1000, close to the centre of these cities. This would be on a walk-in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good (Not relying on pictures from the internet) and is in a spot we like. Thanks in advance for sharing your experience! Sorry, almost forgot to ask - Would it be cheaper to walk-in to these hotels rather than pre book? In Delhi I'd recommend Ajay Guesthouse. Travelled to Delhi twice and stayed there twice. Rooms start from 500 per double. Those ones are quite small. Must say, in Delhi it's hard to get good price/quality rating. I have found this hotel in the Lonely Planet guide. It's in an area starting with a P, many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice. But in general, Delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price. In Varanasi I don't know. I've stayed in a more expensive hotel there, but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor? Also, while travelling ask people where they've been and if they have any hotel recommendations. In Agra I've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended, they found it in the Rough Guide. It was nice and close to the Taj. It was quite easy to find something. (Dont stay in Agra too long. One night is enough!) There were many hotels there. Ive paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean. Good luck, enjoy your time! You may find a normal budget hotel for Rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned, the links below may help you to find good hotels in Delhi and Agra. http://www.goldentriangleindia.com/delhi/hotels-in-delhi.html To Stay in delhi - Hotel Aster Inn is best to stay in delhi. it is in karol bagh. some beautiful locations like close to Karol Bagh Shopping Market, Presidential Palace, and Birla Mandir Temple and Connaught Place and Jantar Mantar are near to it. TO Stay in Agra -Hotel Atithi and Aditya Palace is perfect for you. it is centrally situated. To Stay in Varanasi - Sandeep Hotel is you choice..."
"US battles to save storm victims Watch the airlift Emergency teams in the southern US are battling to reach survivors of Hurricane Katrina, the most destructive storm to hit the country in decades. Hundreds of people are feared dead in Mississippi, and the Louisiana city of New Orleans is badly flooded. The city mayor said rescuers were unable to retrieve the dead. ""They're just pushing them aside,"" he said. Amid worsening conditions, officials plan to evacuate a New Orleans stadium where up to 20,000 people took shelter. The Superdome stadium is without power, and toilets are overflowing. Map of central New Orleans ""It's a very, very desperate situation,"" Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco said. [an error occurred while processing this directive] One resident of New Orleans said escaping from the storm was ""hell"". ""We were screaming, hollering, flashing lights. It was complete chaos,"" Kioka Williams told the Associated Press news agency. She had to hack her way through the ceiling of her beauty shop as flood waters rose in the city of half a million people - much of which lies below sea level. Flooding Walls keeping water out of the bowl-shaped city have been breached, and emergency teams are using helicopters to drop 1,350kg (3,000lb) sandbags and concrete barriers into the gaps. Before the phones went, I was told [my family in Biloxi] had lost their roof, barn, 2 oak trees and many pines and they were letting in water Natalie McVeigh Oakley, England Your Katrina experiences Blogging Katrina New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin said up to 80% of the city was submerged, in some cases by waters 6m (20ft) deep. He warned water levels could still rise. ""Some sections of the city which are dry now could see nine or 10 feet (some 3m) of water,"" he said. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it could take a month to clear the flood waters, and the government's disaster relief agency has urged evacuees not to try to get back to their homes. The BBC's Alastair Leithead in New Orleans says there is panic as vital supplies run out. Heavily armed police have been trying to impose a form of martial law to stem outbreaks of looting. While some looters are stealing non-essential goods, others are simply trying to find food and water. 'Hundreds dead' The situation appears to be even worse in Mississippi. ""You're going to be looking at hundreds dead along the coast,"" a state official said. [an error occurred while processing this directive] Casinos housed in barges have been hurled onto the beach and beyond. Tens of thousands are homeless, and officials say it could be weeks before power is restored. ""I can only imagine that this is what Hiroshima looked like 60 years ago,"" said Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour after viewing the destruction from the air. Survivors are being found all the time, including two children who lost their parents. Harrison County in Mississippi bore the brunt of Hurricane Katrina as it slammed into Biloxi and Gulfport before heading inland. Mississippi media earlier reported 54 people killed in the state. In Biloxi, 30 people were reported dead in one block of flats which was hit by a 9m (30ft) ""storm surge"". The town's death toll may be ""in the hundreds"", municipal spokesman Vincent Creel said. Mobilising Louisiana's Governor Blanco urged residents to spend Wednesday in prayer and assured them the crisis would eventually be overcome. Follow Katrina's path The US Red Cross has mobilised thousands of volunteers for its biggest-ever natural disaster effort and federal emergency teams are being dispatched to affected areas. President George W Bush, who has cut his holiday two days short, has called on Americans to donate to the Red Cross or other organisations. Damage estimates of more than $25bn suggest it could be the US insurance industry's most expensive natural disaster ever. The price of crude oil on the international market hit a record $70.85 a barrel due to the vulnerability of oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The US energy secretary has announced that oil will be released from government petroleum reserves. Return to the top"
"Don't waste your time or money! I took my 3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, I thought it was rubbish and overpriced. Even taking into account the fact that my 3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish. If you have been to the London Aquarium I would not even bother with this. If you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of £30 for 2 two people then go for it. (For some reason itwill not let me rate it one star - it is not rated 5 by me!)"
